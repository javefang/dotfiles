# My Work Environment Bootstrapper

Dot files for

- zsh
- tmux
- vim (neovim)
- git
- alacritty

## How to use

1. Checkout the repo
2. Run `install.sh`

## How it works

The `install.sh` script will backup files at target location, before create a
symlink from file in this repo to the target location. See script for list of
files to be installed.
